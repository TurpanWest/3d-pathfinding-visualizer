# 🎮 Marble Race (React Three Fiber Practice)

This is a small practice project built with **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, **React Three Fiber**, and **Tailwind CSS**.  
It recreates part of the *“Create a Game”* section from the **Three.js Journey** course to explore how physics and 3D rendering work together.
